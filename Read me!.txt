This program is compatible with ​​MATLAB R2022b​​ and is designed to simulate a 5-qubit transverse-field Ising model with ​​periodic boundary conditions​​, where the first qubit is subject to ​​Amplitude Damping (AD) noise​​. The dataset corresponding to this program is: miti_Ising_OQS4_sp5n500gam1p5rho1O1_NMnoshots. This program is adapted from the paper "​​Lindbladian simulation with logarithmic precision scaling via two ancillas​​" by Wenjun Yu, Xiaogang Li, Qi Zhao, and Xiao Yuan, published in Physical Review Letters.
